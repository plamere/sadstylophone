The Stylophone is a miniature analog stylus-operated synthesizer
invented in 1967 by Brian Jarvis and going into production in 1968.
It consists of a metal keyboard played by touching it with a stylus -
each note being connected to a voltage-controlled oscillator via
a different-value resistor - thus closing a circuit. The only other
controls were a power switch and a vibrato control on the front
panel beside the keyboard, and a tuning control on the rear. Some
three million Stylophones were sold, mostly as children's toys.

The Stylophone is a highly constrained musical instrument. There
are only twenty notes, there are no dynamics, there's no way to
shape the loudness envelope, the only real way to affect the sound
is by turning vibrato on and off. It is the saddest of musical
instruments.

The Saddest Stylophone will provide an automatically generated
Stylophone-style accompaniment for just about any song. Choose a
song from the gallery or upload your own song. The Saddest Stylophone
works by analyzing the track (using The Echo Nest analyzer) and
using the analysis to generate the auto accompaniment

Use The Saddest Stylophone to make any song be sad and pathetic.

It uses The Echo Nest API to analyze a track and break it down into
bars, beats, tatums, and then uses this data to create an interactive
visualization of the song. You can then interact with the song in
all sorts of various ways.
